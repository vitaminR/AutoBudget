# Auto-Budget Gamification Layer

## 🎯 Purpose

Increase motivation for ADHD/busy users by layering dopamine triggers and rewards beyond the $100 unlock.

## Core Mechanics

1. **Debt Countdown Bar**

   - Dynamic progress bar, milestone celebrations ($95K → $90K → $85K).
   - Weekly digest: “This PP you cut $450 off your debt.”

2. **Streaks**

   - Track consecutive pay periods completed on time.
   - Reset on miss, restart challenge → “Fresh Start” option.

3. **Mini Achievements**

   - Bronze: All credit bills ✔ for 3 PPs.
   - Silver: First $1,000 debt reduction.
   - Gold: $10,000 milestone.

4. **Challenges**

   - “+1% Save Challenge”: contribute 1% extra this PP.
   - “Cancel unused subscription”: unlock +$25.

5. **Spouse Play**

   - Co-op: both ✔ within 24h = bonus unlock.
   - Competitive: leaderboard for who verifies more bills.

6. **Visualizations**

   - Thermometers for Annual pots.
   - Bill “monsters” shrink/disappear once paid.

7. **Surprise Unlocks**

   - Random “double unlock week” ($150 instead of $100).

8. **Narrative Journey**

   - Map visual: each $5K debt cleared unlocks a new “level.”

9. **Failure Recovery**
   - Missed unlock? Partial unlock path (e.g., pay 1 bill now = $50 release).

## 🧠 ADHD Guardrails

- One focus metric per screen.
- Notifications are positive (progress framing).
- Immediate reward (visuals, confetti, sounds).
