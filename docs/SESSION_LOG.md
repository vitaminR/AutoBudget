# Session Log

- [2025-08-29] Revert of unintended agent edits: reverted agent-made changes across the repository to restore the working tree to the previous committed state.
  - Reason: Edits expanded beyond intended frontend scope and did not follow the project's change protocol (small, reviewable diffs and SESSION_LOG entries).
  - Action: Ran a hard reset to HEAD and removed untracked files added by the agent. Files removed or reverted included (non-exhaustive):
    - frontend: `autobudget_frontend/src/components/StatusDisplay.jsx`, `autobudget_frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`, modifications to `autobudget_frontend/src/pages/Bills.js`, `autobudget_frontend/src/App.js`, and `autobudget_frontend/src/api/client.js`.
    - backend: edits to `autobudget_backend/app.py`, `autobudget_backend/services/pots.py`.
    - tests/tooling/docs added by agent: `tests/test_services.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `setup.py`, many files under `.gemini/` and `.github/`, and expanded `docs/` files.
  - Verification: After revert, working tree was reset to HEAD and untracked files removed with `git clean -fd`.

This entry documents the revert performed to restore repository hygiene. Future agent edits should follow the project's AGENT_GUIDE and include incremental changes with SESSION_LOG entries before committing.
