# Session Log

- [2025-08-29] Revert of unintended agent edits: reverted agent-made changes across the repository to restore the working tree to the previous committed state.
  - Reason: Edits expanded beyond intended frontend scope and did not follow the project's change protocol (small, reviewable diffs and SESSION_LOG entries).
  - Action: Ran a hard reset to HEAD and removed untracked files added by the agent. Files removed or reverted included (non-exhaustive):
    - frontend: `autobudget_frontend/src/components/StatusDisplay.jsx`, `autobudget_frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`, modifications to `autobudget_frontend/src/pages/Bills.js`, `autobudget_frontend/src/App.js`, and `autobudget_frontend/src/api/client.js`.
    - backend: edits to `autobudget_backend/app.py`, `autobudget_backend/services/pots.py`.
    - tests/tooling/docs added by agent: `tests/test_services.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `setup.py`, many files under `.gemini/` and `.github/`, and expanded `docs/` files.
  - Verification: After revert, working tree was reset to HEAD and untracked files removed with `git clean -fd`.

This entry documents the revert performed to restore repository hygiene. Future agent edits should follow the project's AGENT_GUIDE and include incremental changes with SESSION_LOG entries before committing.

- [2025-08-29] Frontend improvements (Navbar, StatusDisplay, Dashboard placeholders).
  - Files added:
    - `autobudget_frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx` — simple navbar with Dashboard and Bills links.
    - `autobudget_frontend/src/components/StatusDisplay.jsx` — centralized loading spinner and error alert component.
  - Files modified:
    - `autobudget_frontend/src/App.js` — imports and renders `Navbar` on all pages.
    - `autobudget_frontend/src/pages/Bills.js` — uses `StatusDisplay` for loading/error states; existing logic preserved.
    - `autobudget_frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — added three placeholder cards: Total Monthly Bills, Next Bill Due, Accounts Reconciled.
  - Scope: frontend-only changes and this single SESSION_LOG entry were committed to follow the project's strict rules for agent edits.
